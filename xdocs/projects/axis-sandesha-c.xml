  <title>Apache Axis Sandesha2/C</title>

  <p>Apache Axis Sandesha2/C moved into the Attic in September 2014.  Sandesha2/C was a C implementation of the WS-ReliableMessaging specification. Sandesha2/C was built on top of Apache Axis2/C Web services engine, as a module. Therefore by using Sandesha2/C you could add reliable messaging capability to Web services hosted using Axis2/C. Sandesha2/C could also be used with Axis2/C client to interact with an already hosted Web services in a reliable manner. </p>
     
  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though the
     issue tracker is read-only. There was no mailing list, instead you 
     can see posts related to Sandesha2/C in the Axis2/C mailing list in the 
     <a href="https://mail-archives.apache.org/">mail archives</a>.
     See the website at
     <a href="https://axis.apache.org/axis2/c/sandesha/">http://axis.apache.org/axis2/c/sandesha</a> 
     for more information on Sandesha2/C.</p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Sandesha2/C outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>
