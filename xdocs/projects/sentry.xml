  <p><a href="https://sentry.apache.org/">Apache Sentry</a>
     moved into the Attic in 2020-12.
     Apache Sentry was a system for enforcing fine grained authorization to data and metadata in Apache Hadoop.</p>

  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at
     <a href="https://sentry.apache.org/">http://sentry.apache.org</a>
     for more information on Sentry.</p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Sentry
     outside of Apache, please let us know so we can link to your project.
