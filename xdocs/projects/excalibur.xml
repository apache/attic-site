  <title>Apache Excalibur</title>

  <p><a href="http://excalibur.apache.org">Apache Excalibur</a> moved into the Attic in December 2010. 
     Apache Excalibur was a Java Inversion of Control container. 
     </p>
     
  <p>The user mailing list, issue tracker, website, and downloads all remain open. See the website at 
     <a href="http://excalibur.apache.org/">http://excalibur.apache.org</a> for more information on Excalibur. </p>

  <p>We do not know of any natural successors or potential forks for Excalibur. As with 
     any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Excalibur outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>

  <p>Archived versions of Excalibur may be downloaded from the 
     <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/excalibur/">Apache Archives</a>. </p>
