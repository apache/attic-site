  <title>Apache C++ Standard Library (STDCXX)</title>

  <p>The <a href="https://stdcxx.apache.org">Apache C++ Standard Library (STDCXX)</a> moved into the Attic in July 2013. 
     The Apache C++ Standard Library project was a collection of algorithms, containers, iterators, and other fundamental 
     components of every piece of software, implemented as C++ classes, templates, and functions essential for writing C++ programs. </p>
     
  <p>The user mailing list, website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at 
     <a href="https://stdcxx.apache.org/">http://stdcxx.apache.org</a> for more information on the project. </p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork the retired project outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>

  <p>Archived versions of the Apache C++ Standard Library (STDCXX) may be downloaded from the 
     <a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/stdcxx/">Apache Archives</a>. </p>
