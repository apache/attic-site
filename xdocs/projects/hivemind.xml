  <title>Apache HiveMind</title>

  <p><a href="https://hivemind.apache.org">Apache HiveMind</a> moved into the Attic in April 2009. 
     HiveMind was a services and configuration microkernel. Its features are also referred to as 
     Inversion of Control (IoC) Container or Lightweight Container.
     Closely linked to Tapestry 4, it lost activity when Tapestry 5 moved to a new IoC container. </p>

  <p><a href="https://markmail.org/thread/hb46sg2nolnntnnz">Discussion on the mailing list</a> 
     indicated that <a href="https://tapestry.apache.org/tapestry5/tapestry-ioc/">Tapestry IoC</a>
     was the natural successor to HiveMind. </p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork HiveMind outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>

  <p>One fork that has been created is Gaderian at <a href="https://gaderian.ops4j.org/">http://gaderian.ops4j.org/</a>. </p>
