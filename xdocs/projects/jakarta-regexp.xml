    <p>Jakarta previously hosted Regexp, a 100% Pure Java Regular Expression package.</p>

    <p>As there were no new features or releases planned, the Jakarta Regexp project was retired in
       April 2011.</p>

    <resource_table project="jakarta" subproject="regexp">
      <mail name="user"/>
      <bugzilla/>
      <svn/>
    </resource_table>

    <p>Jakarta Regexp users are encouraged to use similar features in newer Java versions, such
       as <i>java.util.regexp</i></p>
