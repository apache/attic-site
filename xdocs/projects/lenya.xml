  <title>Apache Lenya</title>

  <p><a href="https://lenya.apache.org">Apache Lenya</a> moved into the Attic in April 2015. 
     Lenya was an Open Source Java/XML Content Management System that came with revision control, 
     multi-site management, scheduling, search, WYSIWYG editors, and workflow.

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Lenya outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>
