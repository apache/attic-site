  <p><a href="https://trafodion.apache.org/">Apache Trafodion</a>
     moved into the Attic in 2021-04.
     Apache Trafodion was a webscale SQL-on-Hadoop solution enabling transactional or operational workloads on Apache Hadoop.</p>

  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at
     <a href="https://trafodion.apache.org/">http://trafodion.apache.org</a>
     for more information on Trafodion.</p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Trafodion
     outside of Apache, please let us know so we can link to your project.
