     moved into the Attic in 2021-12.
     Apache Usergrid was a project to build a BaaS Framework.</p>

  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at
     <a href="https://usergrid.apache.org/">http://usergrid.apache.org</a>
     for more information on Usergrid.</p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Usergrid
     outside of Apache, please let us know so we can link to your project.
