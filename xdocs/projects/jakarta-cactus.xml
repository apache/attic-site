    <p>Jakarta previously hosted Cactus, a simple test framework for unit testing server-side java code. </p>

    <p>In August 2011, Cactus was retired due to a lack of development community.</p>

    <p>Cactus users are encouraged to switch to other techniques for testing.</p>

    <p>The old Cactus website is available online <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/">here</a>
       for archival purposes only.</p> 

  <p>Archived versions of Cactus may be downloaded from the 
     <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/jakarta/cactus/">Apache Archives</a>. </p>
