  <title>Apache Beehive</title>

  <p><a href="http://beehive.apache.org/">Apache Beehive</a> moved into the Attic in January 2010. 
     Apache Beehive was a simple object model built on J2EE and Struts that used annotations to reduce 
     the amount of required code. </p>
     
  <p>The user mailing list, website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at 
     <a href="http://beehive.apache.org/">http://beehive.apache.org</a> for more information on Beehive. </p>

  <p>We do not know of any natural successors or potential forks for Beehive. As with 
     any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Beehive outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>
