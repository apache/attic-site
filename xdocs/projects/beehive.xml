  <title>Apache Beehive</title>

  <p><a href="http://beehive.apache.org/">Apache Beehive</a> moved into the Attic in January 2010. 
     Apache Beehive was a simple object model built on J2EE and Struts that used annotations to reduce 
     the amount of required code. </p>
     
  <p>The user mailing list, website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at 
     <a href="http://beehive.apache.org/">http://beehive.apache.org</a> for more information on Beehive. </p>

  <p>If you are looking for a project to use in place of Beehive, the following have been suggested for its components: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Beehive NetUI / Page Flow - Struts 2 or Spring Web Flow</li>
    <li>Beehive Controls - Spring Beans</li>
    <li>Beehive WSM (web service metadata) - Axis2's implementation of JSR-181</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Beehive outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>

  <p>Archived versions of Beehive may be downloaded from the 
     <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/beehive/">Apache Archives</a>. </p>
