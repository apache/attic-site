  <title>Apache Lenya</title>

  <p><a href="http://lenya.apache.org">Apache Lenya</a> moved into the Attic in April 2015. 
     Lenya was an Open Source Java/XML Content Management System that came with revision control, 
     multi-site management, scheduling, search, WYSIWYG editors, and workflow.
  </p>
     
  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at 
     <a href="http://lenya.apache.org/">http://lenya.apache.org</a> for more information on Lenya. </p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Lenya outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>

  <p>Archived versions of the Lenya may be downloaded from the 
     <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/lenya/">Apache Archives</a>. </p>
