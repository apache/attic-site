  <title>Apache ObJectRelationalBridge (OJB)</title>

  <p><a href="https://db.apache.org/ojb">Apache ObJectRelationalBridge (OJB)</a>
     moved into the Attic in January 2011. Apache OJB was an Object/Relational
     mapping tool that allowed transparent persistence for Java Objects against
     relational databases.</p>

  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though the
     issue tracker is read-only. The user mailing list has been closed down,
     but old posts can be browsed in the
     <a href="https://mail-archives.apache.org/">mail archives</a>.
     See the website at
     <a href="https://db.apache.org/ojb/">http://db.apache.org/ojb</a> for more
     information on OJB.</p>

  <p>If you are looking for a project to use in place of OJB, implementations
     of the standards <a href="https://db.apache.org/jdo">Java Data Objects
     (JDO)</a> and <a href="">Java Persistence API (JPA)</a> may be good
     starting points. The Apache Software Foundation hosts the following
     alternatives:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://cayenne.apache.org/">Apache Cayenne</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://incubator.apache.org/empire-db/">Apache Empire-db</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://openjpa.apache.org/">Apache OpenJPA</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://db.apache.org/torque">Apache Torque</a></li>
      </ul></p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork OJB
     outside of Apache, please let us know so we can link to your project.</p>

  <p>Archived versions of OJB may be downloaded from the
     <a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/db/ojb/">Apache Archives</a>.</p>
