  <p><a href="https://clerezza.apache.org/">Apache Clerezza</a>
     moved into the Attic in 2022-06.
     Apache Clerezza was a service platform which provided a set of functionality for management of semantically linked data accessible through RESTful Web Services and in a secured way.</p>

  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at
     <a href="https://clerezza.apache.org/">http://clerezza.apache.org</a>
     for more information on Clerezza.</p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Clerezza
     outside of Apache, please let us know so we can link to your project.
