<p>At some point a project will vote to join the Attic. The following defines a process 
     to move that project into the Attic and gently close it down. </p>
<ol>
    <li>Open a JIRA item - 'Move ${project} to the Attic'. Add the following items to the details: 
      <ul>
        <li>Confirm Board Resolution (if TLP)</li>
        <li>Delete from committee-info.txt (if TLP)</li>
        <li>Remove VP entry on http://www.apache.org/foundation/ (if TLP)</li>
        <li>Inform users</li>
        <li>Create page on Attic site</li>
        <li>Obtain SVN karma and point SVN mails to general at attic</li>
        <li>i. Update website with Attic notice</li>
        <li>ii. Update the project DOAP file</li>
        <li>Remove from www.apache.org navigation (if TLP)</li>
        <li>Announce on announce at apache.org</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Open an Infrastructure JIRA issue identifying the resources that need turning off/making read only. Typically:
      <ul>
        <li>Update HEADER.html in downloads</li>
        <li>Make SVN + JIRA/Bugzilla read-only</li>
        <li>Turn off automated builds</li>
        <li>Close down infrastructure resources</li>
        <li>JIRA, Bugzilla + SVN if no one has karma</li>
        <li>Closing down of dev@, commits@ and private@ mailing lists</li>
        <li>Read-only in wiki (be it Confluence or Moinmoin)</li>
        <li>Delete unix/ldap group</li>
        <li>New moderator for user@ list (with volunteer named)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Open a new JIRA issue with a due date 6 months in the future. When the due date is up, the issue should be moved to the Infrastructure JIRA and ask to:
      <ul>
        <li>delete the user list (unless still active)</li>
        <li>strip dist/project and add a .htaccess containing:
          <pre>RedirectMatch permanent .* http://attic.apache.org/projects/${project}.html</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

  </ol>

<h4 id="confirm-resolution">
   How To: Confirm Board Resolution (if TLP)
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Check previous Board minutes (in SVN or to committers@) to confirm project was retired. </p>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="delete-pmc">
   How To: Delete from committee-info.txt
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Someone needs to remove the PMC from the committee-info file. </p>
<p>If the outgoing PMC chair is not chair of any other PMCs, 
  then ask infra to adjust the 'pmc-chairs' LDAP group accordingly.</p>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="informing">
   How To: Inform users of the move to the Attic
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>You should let the users know that the project is moving into the Attic. Consider the following template: </p>
<pre>
A heads up for the ${project} user community that the ${project} project has 
been 'moved to the Attic'. This means that the ${project} developers (more 
formally its Project Management Committee) have voted to retire ${project} 
and move the responsibility for its oversight over to the Attic project.

Loosely speaking this means that the projects resources will be moved to a 
read-only state.

You can read more about the Apache Attic and the process of moving to the 
Attic at http://attic.apache.org.

You can follow this process in JIRA: 
 
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ATTIC-${#}

Thanks,

${Name} on behalf of ${project} + the Attic. 
  </pre>
<p>Bear in mind to subscribe to the user list to avoid moderation. Also bear in mind that the user mailing list may 
     already know and you can skip this stage. Make sure you read that thread if it does exist. </p>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="atticsite">
   How To: Create page on Attic site
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>A simple page should be created on the Attic site. Use existing pages as templates and make sure you link to the Apache Archives to get the software. While you are here, add the user mailing list to the list 
     of sites under the Attic's oversight. </p>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="svnkarma">
   How To: Obtain SVN karma
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Change asf-authorization-template so that the attic-pmc has karma instead of the defunct project. </p>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="svnmail">
   How To: Point SVN mails to general at attic
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Change asf-mailer.conf so that SVN notification emails go to the Attic general list. </p>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="website">
   How To: Adding an Attic notice to the website
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>A banner needs to be added to the website indicating that it is now in the Attic. This needs to be done in a lightweight way 
     without having to learn how the project manage their site. One way is to (carefully!) search and replace for a common 
     tag such as the body tag. Another is to edit the CSS. </p>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="doap">
   How To: Update the project DOAP file
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Identify whether the project has a DOAP file (see the <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/infrastructure/site-tools/trunk/projects/files.xml">files.xml</a> file) and if it does update the PMC to the Attic and add a category of <em>retired</em>. </p>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="www.apache">
   How To: Remove from www.apache.org navigation
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>As a retired project, a link on the front page of Apache is no longer necessary. Remove the link and regenerate the main Apache site. </p>
<p>It's also worth checking that the VP link from http://www.apache.org/foundation/ has been removed. </p>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="announce">
   How To: Announce on announce@apache.org
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Announce that the project is now retired. Consider the following template. </p>
<pre>
Announcing that the Apache ${project} committers have voted to retire
the project due to inactivity. ${project} was {boilerplate}.

Retiring a project is not as simple as turning everything off, as
existing users need to both know that the project is retiring and
retain access to the necessary information for their own development
efforts.

You can read more about ${project}'s retirement at:

   http://attic.apache.org/projects/${project}.html

The user mailing list remains open, while the rest of the project's
resources will continue to be available in a read-only state -
website, wikis, svn, downloads and bug tracker with no change in url.

Providing process and solutions to make it clear when an Apache
project has reached its end of life is the role of the Apache Attic,
and you can read more about that at:

   http://attic.apache.org/

Thanks,

${NAME}
on behalf of the Apache Attic and the now retired Apache ${project} project
  </pre>
<p>It's important to include the boilerplate from the project's site so people 
     know what we're talking about. </p>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="downloads">
   How To: Update HEADER.html in downloads
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Another area to take note of the move to the Attic is the download section. Add or update a HEADER.html file that says something like: </p>
<pre>
&lt;h1&gt;Project Retired&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yyyy/mm/dd - Apache ${project} has been retired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, please explore the Attic at http://attic.apache.org&lt;/p&gt;
