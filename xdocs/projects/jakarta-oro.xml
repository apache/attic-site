  <title>Jakarta ORO</title>

    <p>Jakarta previously hosted ORO, a set of text-processing Java classes that provide Perl5 compatible
       regular expressions, AWK-like regular expressions, glob expressions, and utility classes for
       performing substitutions, splits, filtering filenames, etc.</p>

    <p>As there were no new features or releases planned, the Jakarta ORO project was retired in
       September 2010.</p>

    <p>ORO users are encouraged to use similar features in newer Java versions, where available.</p>

    <p>The old ORO website is available online <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/">here</a>
       for archival purposes only.</p> 

  <p>Archived versions of ORO may be downloaded from the 
     <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/jakarta/oro/">Apache Archives</a>. </p>
