<p>At some point a project will vote to join the Attic. The following defines a process 
     to move that project into the Attic and gently close it down. </p>
<ol>
    <li>Open a JIRA item - 'Move ${project} to the Attic'. </li>
    <li>Open a subtask: Board resolution successful. </li>
    <li>Ensure a Board resolution is on the next Board agenda. Once this is successful, continue. </li>
    <li>Open the following subtasks (see below for more information): 
      <ul>
        <li>Inform users</li>
        <li>Update website with Attic notice</li>
        <li>Update README in downloads</li>
        <li>Make SVN + JIRA/Bugzilla read-only</li>
        <li>Create page on Attic site</li>
        <li>Turn off automated builds</li>
        <li>Remove from www.apache.org navigation</li>
        <li>Close down infrastructure resources</li>
        <li>Announce on announce at apache.org</li>

<h4 id="informing">
   Informing users of the vote
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Your first task is to let the users know that the project is moving into the Attic. Consider the following template: </p>
<pre>
A heads up for the ${project} user community that the ${project} project has 
been 'moved to the Attic'. This means that the ${project} developers (more 
formally its Project Management Committee) have voted to retire ${project} 
and move the responsibility for its oversight over to the Attic project.

Loosely speaking this means that the projects resources will be moved to a 
read-only state.

You can read more about the Apache Attic and the process of moving to the 
Attic at http://attic.apache.org.

You can follow this process in JIRA: 
 
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ATTIC-${#}

Thanks,

${Name} on behalf of ${project} + the Attic. 
  </pre>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="website">
   Adding an Attic notice to the website
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>A banner needs to be added to the website indicating that it is now in the Attic. This needs to be done in a lightweight way 
     without having to learn how the project manage their site. The simplest way is to (carefully!) search and replace for a common 
     tag such as the body tag. </p>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="downloads">
   Update README in downloads
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Another area to take note of the move to the Attic is the download section. Add or update a README.html file that says something like: </p>
<pre>
YYYY/MM/DD - Apache ${project} has been retired.

For more information, please explore the Attic at http://attic.apache.org 
  </pre>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="readonly">
   Make SVN + JIRA/Bugzilla read-only
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Someone with SVN karma karma should edit the asf-authorization file. The project's karma should be moved to read-only and the commit 
     notification should be pointed to general@attic.apache.org. </p>
<p>Someone with JIRA or Bugzilla administrative rights should modify the project to be read-only. In JIRA this means moving it to the Retired 
     category and applying the Read-Only Permissions. </p>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="atticsite">
   Create page on Attic site
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>A simple page should be created on the Attic site. Use existing pages as templates. While you are here, add the user mailing list to the list 
     of sites under the Attic's oversight. </p>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="builds">
   Turn off automated builds
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Research to find out if an automated build exists and get it turned off. </p>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="www.apache">
   Remove from www.apache.org navigation
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>As a retired project, a link on the front page of Apache is no longer necessary. Remove the link and regenerate the main Apache site. </p>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="infra">
   Close down infrastructure resources
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Open a ticket with Infrastructure asking for resources to be closed down. This includes: </p>
<ul>
    <li>JIRA, Bugzilla + SVN if no one has karma</li>
    <li>Closing down of dev@, commits@ and private@ mailing lists</li>
    <li>Read-only in wiki (be it Confluence or Moinmoin)</li>
    <li>Delete unix group</li>
    <li>New moderator for user@ list</li>
  </ul>
<p>Bear in mind you will need to identify who is volunteering as the new moderator for the user@ list will be. </p>
</div>
                 
<h4 id="announce">
   Announce on announce@apache.org
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Announce that the project is now retired. Consider the following template. </p>
<pre>
Announcing that the Apache ${project} committers have voted to retire
the project due to inactivity. ${project} was {boilerplate}.

Retiring a project is not as simple as turning everything off, as
existing users need to both know that the project is retiring and
retain access to the necessary information for their own development
efforts.

You can read more about ${project}'s retirement at:

   http://attic.apache.org/projects/${project}.html

The user mailing list remains open, while the rest of the project's
resources will continue to be available in a read-only state -
website, wikis, svn, downloads and bug tracker with no change in url.

Providing process and solutions to make it clear when an Apache
project has reached its end of life is the role of the Apache Attic,
and you can read more about that at:

   http://attic.apache.org/

Thanks,

${NAME}
on behalf of the Apache Attic and the now retired Apache ${project} project
  </pre>
<p>It's important to include the boilerplate from the project's site so people 
     know what we're talking about. </p>
