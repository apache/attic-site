  <title>Apache Axis Savan/Java</title>

  <p>Apache Axis Savan/Java moved into the Attic in September 2014. Savan/Java was a Java implementation of WS-Eventing specification. Savan/Java was built on top of Axis2/Java. Therefore by using Savan/Java you could add WS-Eventing capability to Web services hosted using Axis2/Java. Savan/Java was designed as a general publisher/subscriber tool. The arcitecture was designed to abstract the general publisher/subscriber features so that people could support more than one publisher/subscriber mechanisms within the same infrastructure. </p>
     
  <p>The user mailing list, issue tracker and website all remain open, though the 
     issue tracker is read-only. No downloads were made available. See the website at
     <a href="https://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/savan/">http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/savan</a> 
     for limited additional information on Savan/Java. Note that the website is incorrect with regards to where 
     the source code is. You can find the source code at <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/axis/axis2/java/savan/">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/axis/axis2/java/savan/</a>. Also note the issue tracker was <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SAVAN">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SAVAN</a>. </p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Savan/Java outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>
