  <title>Apache Shale</title>

  <p><a href="https://shale.apache.org">Apache Shale</a> moved into the Attic in May 2009. 
     Shale was a web application framework, fundamentally based on JavaServer Faces. This 
     blog entry from Kito Mann is an excellent discussion of Shale's retirement: 
     <a href="https://blogs.jsfcentral.com/editorsdesk/entry/shale_in_the_attic">http://blogs.jsfcentral.com/editorsdesk/entry/shale_in_the_attic</a>. </p>
     
  <p><a href="https://markmail.org/message/liexnvlxdlahlr74">Discussion on the mailing list</a> 
     indicated that <a href="https://seamframework.org">Seam</a> and <a href="https://myfaces.apache.org">MyFaces</a> 
     were the natural successors to Shale. </p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Shale outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>

  <p>The Shale Test code has been forked into the MyFaces project - 
     <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/myfaces/test/trunk/">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/myfaces/test/trunk/</a>.</p>
