  <title>Apache Wink</title>

  <p><a href="https://wink.apache.org">Apache Wink</a> moved into the Attic in April 2017. 
Apache Wink was a simple yet solid framework for building RESTful Web services. It is comprised of a Server module and a Client module for developing and consuming RESTful Web services.</p>
