  <p><a href="https://falcon.apache.org/">Apache Falcon</a>
     moved into the Attic in June 2019.
     Apache Falcon was a data processing and management solution for Hadoop designed for data motion, coordination of data pipelines, lifecycle management, and data discovery.
     Falcon enabled end consumers to quickly onboard their data and its associated processing and management tasks on Hadoop clusters.</p>

  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at
     <a href="https://falcon.apache.org/">http://falcon.apache.org</a>
     for more information on Falcon.</p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Falcon
     outside of Apache, please let us know so we can link to your project.
