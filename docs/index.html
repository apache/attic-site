    The Apache Attic was created in December 2008 to provide process and solutions to make it 
    clear when an Apache project has reached its end of life. Specifically to be:  
  </p>
<p style="font-family: monospace">
    "responsible for the oversight of projects which otherwise would not have 
    oversight; and be it further ... is not authorized to actively develop and release the 
    projects under its oversight"

<p>It is intended to: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Be non-impacting to users</li>
    <li>Provide restricted oversight for these codebases</li>
    <li>Provide oversight for active user lists with no Project Management Committee (PMC)</li>

   Getting into the Attic
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>There are two expected mechanisms by which a project may enter the Attic. Either the managing 
     Project Management Committee (PMC) decides it would like to move the project, or The 
     Apache Software Foundation's board dissolves the PMC and chooses to move the project. </p>

<h4 id="candidates">
   When should a project move to the Attic?
</h4>
<div class="section-content">
<p>Projects whose PMC are unable to muster 3 votes for a release, who have no active committers or 
     are unable to fulfill their reporting duties to the board are all good candidates for the Attic. </p>
