  <p><a href="https://reef.apache.org/">Apache REEF</a>
     moved into the Attic in 2022-07.
     Apache REEF (Retainable Evaluator Execution Frameworks) mission was to provide a library for developing portable applications for cluster resource managers such as Apache Hadoop™ YARN or Apache Mesos™.</p>

  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at
     <a href="https://reef.apache.org/">http://reef.apache.org</a>
     for more information on REEF.</p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork REEF
     outside of Apache, please let us know so we can link to your project.
