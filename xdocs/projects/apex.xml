  <p><a href="https://apex.apache.org/">Apache Apex</a>
     moved into the Attic in September 2019.
     Apache Apex was a unified platform for big data stream and batch processing. Use cases included ingestion, ETL, real-time analytics, alerts and real-time actions.</p>

  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at
     <a href="https://apex.apache.org/">http://apex.apache.org</a>
     for more information on Apex.</p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Apex
     outside of Apache, please let us know so we can link to your project.
