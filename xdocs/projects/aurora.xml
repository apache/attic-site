  <title>Apache Aurora</title>

  <p><a href="https://aurora.apache.org/">Apache Aurora</a>
     moved into the Attic in February 2020.
     Apache Aurora was a Mesos framework for long-running services, cron jobs, and ad-hoc jobs.</p>

  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at
     <a href="https://aurora.apache.org/">http://aurora.apache.org</a>
     for more information on Aurora.</p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Aurora
     outside of Apache, please let us know so we can link to your project.
