  <title>Apache WS Muse</title>

  <p>Apache WS Muse moved into the Attic in January 2013. 
     Muse was a Java-based implementation of the WS-ResourceFramework (WSRF), WS-BaseNotification (WSN), 
     and WS-DistributedManagement (WSDM) specifications. </p>

  <p>The <a href="https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/ws-muse-user/">user mailing list</a>, downloads and issue tracker all remain, but are read-only. The website appears to have been removed. </p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Muse outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>
  
  <p>Archived versions of Muse may be downloaded from the 
     <a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/ws/muse/">Apache Archives</a>. </p>

  <p>One fork that has been created is <i>amused</i>, available at 
     <a href="https://52north.org/communities/sensorweb/amused/">http://52north.org/communities/sensorweb/amused</a>. </p>
