  <p><a href="https://mxnet.apache.org/">Apache MXNet</a>
     moved into the Attic in 2023-09.
     Apache MXNet was a flexible and efficient library for Deep Learning.</p>

  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at
     <a href="https://mxnet.apache.org/">http://mxnet.apache.org</a>
     for more information on MXNet.</p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork MXNet
     outside of Apache, please let us know so we can link to your project.
