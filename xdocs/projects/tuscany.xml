  <title>Apache Tuscany</title>

  <p><a href="http://tuscany.apache.org">Apache Tuscany</a> moved into the Attic in May 2016. 
     Tuscany simplified the task of developing service-oriented architectured solutions by providing a comprehensive infrastructure for development and management, based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Component_Architecture">Service Component Architecture</a> standard. </p>
