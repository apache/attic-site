    <p>Jakarta previously hosted ECS (Element Construction Set), a Java API for generating elements
       for any of a variety of markup languages (examples included HTML 4.0 and XML).</p>

    <p>In September 2010, ECS was retired due to a lack of development community.</p>

    <p>ECS users are encouraged to switch to other techniques for markup generation.</p>
