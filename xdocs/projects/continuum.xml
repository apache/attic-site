  <title>Apache Continuum</title>

  <p><a href="https://continuum.apache.org">Apache Continuum</a> moved into the Attic in May 2016. 
     Continuum was an enterprise-ready continuous integration server with features such as automated builds, release management, role-based security, and integration with popular build tools and source control management systems. </p>
