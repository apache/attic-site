     moved into the Attic in 2020-08.
     Apache Lens was Unified analytics platform.</p>

  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at
     <a href="https://lens.apache.org/">http://lens.apache.org</a>
     for more information on Lens.</p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Lens
     outside of Apache, please let us know so we can link to your project.
