  <p><a href="https://tiles.apache.org">Apache Tiles</a> moved into the Attic
    in December 2018. 
    Apache Tilesâ„¢ is a templating framework built to simplify the
    development of web application user interfaces.
  </p>

     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at
     <a href="https://tiles.apache.org/">http://tiles.apache.org</a>
