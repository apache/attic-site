  <title>Apache Lucy</title>

  <p><a href="https://lucy.apache.org">Apache Lucy</a> moved into the Attic
    in June 2018. 
    The Apache Lucy search engine library provides full-text search for
    dynamic programming languages.
    It is a "loose C" port of the Apache Luceneâ„¢ search engine library
    for Java.
  </p>

  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at
     <a href="https://lucy.apache.org/">http://lucy.apache.org</a>
     for more information on Lucy. </p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Lucy
     outside of Apache, please let us know so we can link to your project.
