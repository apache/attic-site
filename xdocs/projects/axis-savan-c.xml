  <title>Apache Axis Savan/C</title>

  <p>Apache Axis Savan/C moved into the Attic in September 2014. Savan/C was a C implementation of WS-Eventing specification. Savan/C was built on top of Axis2/C. Therefore by using Savan/C you could add WS-Eventing capability to Web services hosted using Axis2/C. Savan/C was designed as a general publisher/subscriber tool. The arcitecture was designed to abstract the general publisher/subscriber features so that people could support more than one publisher/subscriber mechanisms within the same infrastructure. </p>
     
  <p>The website and downloads. There was no dedicated issue tracker, instead any issues raised 
     were in the <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS2C">Axis2/C</a> JIRA project. 
     There was no mailing list, instead you 
     can see posts related to Savan/C in the Axis2/C mailing list in the 
     <a href="https://mail-archives.apache.org/">mail archives</a>.
     See the website at
     <a href="https://axis.apache.org/axis2/c/savan/">http://axis.apache.org/axis2/c/savan</a> 
     for more information on Savan/C.</p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Savan/C outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>
  
  <p>Archived versions of Savan/C may be downloaded from the 
     <a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/ws/savan/c/">Apache Archives</a>. </p>
