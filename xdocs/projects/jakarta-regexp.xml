  <title>Jakarta Regexp</title>

    <p>Jakarta previously hosted Regexp, a 100% Pure Java Regular Expression package.</p>

    <p>As there were no new features or releases planned, the Jakarta Regexp project was retired in
       April 2011.</p>

    <p>Jakarta Regexp users are encouraged to use similar features in newer Java versions, such
       as <i>java.util.regexp</i></p>

    <p>The old Jakarta Regexp website is available online <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/regexp/">here</a>
       for archival purposes only.</p>

  <p>Archived versions of Jakarta Regexp may be downloaded from the 
     <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/jakarta/regexp/">Apache Archives</a>. </p>
