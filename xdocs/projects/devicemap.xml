  <title>Apache DeviceMap</title>

  <p><a href="https://devicemap.apache.org">Apache DeviceMap</a> moved into the Attic in December 2016. 
     Apache DeviceMap was a project to create a data repository containing device information, images and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices. </p>
     
  <resource_table project="devicemap">
    <mail name="commits"/>
    <jira key="DMAP"/>
    <svn/>
    <cwiki/>
  </resource_table>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork DeviceMap outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>

  <p>Some related projects to DeviceMap are: </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://openddr.mobi/">OpenDDR</a> - this is a new version of OpenDDR, parts of which were migrated to Apache Devicemap, and now have been merged back to OpenDDR. </li>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/nielsbasjes/yauaa">YAUAA: Yet Another UserAgent Analyzer</a> is an Apache licensed alternative to DeviceMap. Rather than employing a fixed collection of User-Agent (UA) strings as in DeviceMap, YAUAA performs a semantic analysis to determine certain attributes of the UA. </li>

    <li><a href="https://devicedetector.net/">DeviceDetector</a> is an LGPL 3.0 licensed PHP project that parses YAML based device data in a similar way as DeviceMap/OpenDDR do with W3C compatible data. </li>

    <li><a href="https://mobiledetect.net/">mobiledetect</a> is an MIT licensed PHP project for detecting mobile devices. </li>
  </ul>
