  <p><a href="https://predictionio.apache.org/">Apache PredictionIO</a>
     moved into the Attic in Sep 2020.
     Apache PredictionIO was a machine learning server built on top of state-of-the-art open
      source stack, that enables developers to manage and deploy production-ready
      predictive services for various kinds of machine learning tasks.</p>

  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at
     <a href="https://predictionio.apache.org/">http://predictionio.apache.org</a>
     for more information on PredictionIO.</p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork PredictionIO
     outside of Apache, please let us know so we can link to your project.
