  <title>Apache AxKit</title>

  <p><a href="http://axkit.org">Apache AxKit</a> moved into the Attic in August 2009. 
     Apache AxKit was an XML Application Server for Apache. It provided on-the-fly 
     conversion from XML to any format, such as HTML, WAP or text using either W3C 
     standard techniques, or flexible custom code.</p>
     
  <p>The user mailing list, website, and downloads all remain open. There was no
     issue tracker for the project. See the website at 
     <a href="http://axkit.org/">http://axkit.org</a> for more information on AxKit. </p>

  <p>We do not know of any natural successors or potential forks for AxKit. As with 
     any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork AxKit outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>

  <p>Archived versions of AxKit may be downloaded from the 
     <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/xml/axkit/">Apache Archives</a>. </p>
