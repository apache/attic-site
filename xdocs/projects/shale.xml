  <title>Apache Shale</title>

  <p><a href="http://shale.apache.org">Apache Shale</a> moved into the Attic in May 2009. 
     Shale was a web application framework, fundamentally based on JavaServer Faces. This 
     blog entry from Kito Mann is an excellent discussion of Shale's retirement: 
     <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/2009/05/11/shale-attic">http://weblogs.java.net/blog/2009/05/11/shale-attic</a>. </p>
     
  <p>The user mailing list, website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at 
     <a href="http://shale.apache.org/">http://shale.apache.org</a> for more information on Shale. </p>

  <p><a href="http://markmail.org/message/liexnvlxdlahlr74">Discussion on the mailing list</a> 
     indicated that <a href="http://seamframework.org">Seam</a> and <a href="http://myfaces.apache.org">MyFaces</a> 
     were the natural successors to Shale. </p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Shale outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>

  <p>The Shale Test code has been forked into the MyFaces project - 
     <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/myfaces/test/trunk/">http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/myfaces/test/trunk/</a>.</p>
