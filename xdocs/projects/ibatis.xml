  <title>Apache iBATIS</title>

  <p><a href="https://ibatis.apache.org">Apache iBATIS</a> moved into the Attic in June 2010. 
     iBATIS was a data mapper framework that made it easier to use a relational database 
     with object-oriented applications. There were both Java and .Net implementations. </p>

  <p>The iBATIS committers moved over to 
     <a href="https://www.mybatis.org/">MyBatis</a>
     which is the natural successor to iBATIS. </p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork iBATIS outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>

  <resource_table project="ibatis">
  <mail name="commits,user-cs,user-java"/>
  <jira/>
  </resource_table>

  <p>Archived versions of iBATIS may be downloaded from the 
     <a href="https://archive.apache.org/dist/ibatis/">Apache Archives</a>. </p>

  <p>As mentioned above, one fork that has been created is MyBatis at 
     <a href="https://www.mybatis.org/">http://www.mybatis.org/</a>. </p>
