  <p><a href="https://stanbol.apache.org/">Apache Stanbol</a>
     moved into the Attic in April 2020.
     Apache Stanbol was a set of reusable components for semantic content management.</p>

  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at
     <a href="https://stanbol.apache.org/">http://stanbol.apache.org</a>
     for more information on Stanbol.</p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Stanbol
     outside of Apache, please let us know so we can link to your project.
