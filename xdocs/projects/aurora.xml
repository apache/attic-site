     moved into the Attic in January 2020.
     Apache Aurora implemented a parallel XML Query processor.</p>

  <p>The website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at
     <a href="http://Aurora.apache.org/">http://Aurora.apache.org</a>
     for more information on Aurora.</p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Aurora
     outside of Apache, please let us know so we can link to your project.
