  <title>Jakarta ORO</title>

    <p>Jakarta previously hosted ORO, a set of text-processing Java classes that provide Perl5 compatible
       regular expressions, AWK-like regular expressions, glob expressions, and utility classes for
       performing substitutions, splits, filtering filenames, etc.</p>

    <p>As there were no new features or releases planned, the Jakarta ORO project was retired in
       September 2010.</p>

    <p>ORO users are encouraged to use similar features in newer Java versions, where available.</p>
