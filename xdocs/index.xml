  <title>The Apache Attic</title>

  <p>
    The Apache Attic was created in 
    <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2008/board_minutes_2008_11_19.txt">November 2008</a> 
    to provide process and solutions to make it clear when an Apache project has reached its 
    end of life. Specifically to be:  
  </p>
  <p style="font-family: monospace">
    "responsible for the oversight of projects which otherwise would not have 
    oversight; and be it further ... is not authorized to actively develop and release the 
    projects under its oversight"
  </p>

  <p>It is intended to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Be non-impacting to users</li>
    <li>Provide restricted oversight for these codebases</li>
    <li>Provide oversight for active user lists with no Project Management Committee (PMC)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It is not intended to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rebuild community</li>
    <li>Make bugfixes</li>
    <li>Make releases</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="incoming">
  <title>Getting into the Attic</title>

  <p>There are two expected mechanisms by which a project may enter the Attic. Either the managing 
     Project Management Committee (PMC) decides it would like to move the project, or The 
     Apache Software Foundation's board dissolves the PMC and chooses to move the project. </p>
</section>

<section id="candidates">
  <title>When should a project move to the Attic?</title>

  <p>Projects whose PMC are unable to muster 3 votes for a release, who have no active committers or 
     are unable to fulfill their reporting duties to the board are all good candidates for the Attic. </p>
</section>

<section id="process">
  <title>Process of moving into the Attic</title>

  <p>This won't be defined fully until we actually start moving projects into the Attic. The following is a rough general plan of action. </p>
  <ol start="0">
    <li>Prior to this the Apache Board has moved the oversight of the project from its prior PMC to the Attic PMC. </li>
    <li>Indicate on websites that the project is in the Attic</li>
    <li>Make the SVN read only</li>
    <li>Inform user email list</li>
    <li>Consider killing user email list</li>
    <li>Kill the dev list</li>
    <li>README on archives for downloads</li>
    <li>Kill automated builds</li>
    <li>Retire in issue-trackers</li>
    <li>Remove from www.apache.org navigation</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section id="departure">
  <title>Process of leaving the Attic again</title>

  <p>Options are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Forking the project - we'll link to any forks which have been created so please let us know</li>
    <li>Restarting the community in the Apache Incubator</li>
    <li>Recreating a PMC for the project</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="contact">
  <title>Contacting the Attic PMC</title>

  <p>The Attic is managed by a Project Management Committee (PMC). Discussions are found on 
     the <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/attic-general/">general@ mailing list</a>
     and you are welcome to subscribe. </p>
