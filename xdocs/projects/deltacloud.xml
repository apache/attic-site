  <title>Apache Deltacloud</title>

  <p><a href="http://deltacloud.apache.org">Apache Deltacloud</a> moved into the Attic in July 2015. 
  Deltacloud provided the API server and drivers necessary for connecting to cloud providers via 
  a cloud abstraction API. </p>
     
  <p>The user mailing list, website, downloads and issue tracker all remain open, though 
     the issue tracker is read-only. See the website at 
     <a href="http://deltacloud.apache.org/">http://deltacloud.apache.org</a> for more information on Deltacloud. </p>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork Deltacloud outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>

  <p>Archived versions of the Deltacloud may be downloaded from the 
     <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/deltacloud/">Apache Archives</a>. </p>
