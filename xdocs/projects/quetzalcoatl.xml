  <title>Apache Quetzalcoatl</title>

  <p>Apache Quetzalcoatl moved into the Attic in June 2010. 
     Quetzalcoatl, or Quetz as it was more commonly known, was a project 
     charged with the creation and maintenance of open-source software 
     related to <a href="https://www.modpython.org">mod_python</a> and the 
     Python programming language.

     Mainly formed around the mod_python subproject, it didn't have activity 
     in the mod_python community to drive the larger project along. </p>

  <p>The mod_python website and downloads remain open.
     See the website at 
     <a href="https://www.modpython.org/">http://www.modpython.org</a> for more information on mod_python. 
     Quetz itself never had a website. </p>

  <resource_table project="quetzalcoatl">
    <no_website/>
    <no_lists/>
    <no_downloads/>

  </resource_table>

  <p>As with any project in the Attic - if you should choose to fork mod_python outside of Apache, 
     please let us know so we can link to your project. </p>
